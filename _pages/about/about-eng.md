Jiyeon Jeon, born in Seoul, South Korea, is a musician and educator. She began playing the piano at the age of 6.  

She has always loved Motown-style Black music and is strongly influenced by it, which is why she fundamentally pursues groovy music. She constantly explores the connection between a pure groove – one that touches the heart and makes our bodies react immediately – and melodies that are both lyrical and sophisticated.  

She works intensively on finding harmonic progressions that may sound lonely and melancholic, yet still hopeful at the same time. She views all of these musical processes as her way of creating something “Jiyeonish” (지연스러움) – something that is uniquely Jiyeon.  

She completed her Bachelor’s degree in Jazz Piano at KyungHee University and her Master’s degree in Classical Music Education at Sookmyung Women’s University in Seoul, Korea. And she obtained a secondary school music teacher’s certificate.

After that, she completed another Master’s degree  at the City University of New York, Queens College, in New York, USA.  

Since finishing her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Jazz Piano, Jiyeon Jeon has gained over 20 years of experience on stage and in the studio. She has performed concerts in Korea, Japan, China, the USA, and Germany, and has released more than 12 albums as a composer, arranger, and session pianist.  

*Her own project album: Jiyeon Jeon / Journey Together (2025.12)  
*Her own co-projects: so far, two singles released in Korea 2013 and 2024  

In 2017, Jiyeon Jeon emigrated to Germany. Since then, she has been musically active and moves freely between Korea and Germany.  

She lives with her family in Hermsdorf, Berlin, Germany. 🇩🇪

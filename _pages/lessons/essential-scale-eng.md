- Understanding the intervals that best characterize each scale. Let's try to understand the sound of a solo that makes good use of character notes. I teach you how to solo linguistically. The lesson focuses on one standard tunes and its  functional harmony. It is not a lesson focused on information delivery, but monitors the learner every moment. There is always a demonstration performance from me. This will be a lesson that will improve your skills. If you would like to work hard with me, please contact. Those who want to start from the basics. Those who are afraid to start solo for the first time. Or those who have not always been able to practice because they are not organized in theory. These are lessons for beginners or piano teachers as well.
